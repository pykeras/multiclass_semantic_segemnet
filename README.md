**This is a step-by-step guide to building and understanding semantic segmentation (multiclass version)**

  **sample images after merging (face and hair) masks**:

This dataset will be used to create a segmentation.

Also, this was a **real world project** for a hair color production company in the early days of my career (on their own dataset)
