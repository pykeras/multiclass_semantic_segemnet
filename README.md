**This is a step-by-step guide to building and understanding semantic segmentation**

- _By using celebAMask dataset, we'll try to segment the skin and hair._

This dataset will be used to create a segmentation, followed by changing hair color as a simple fun application.

Also, this was a **real world project** for a hair color production company in the early days of my career (on their own dataset)
